# Redux / React / Typescript practice

This project is a React, Redux, TypeScript practice app based on the Redux tutorial: <https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials>. The React and Redux parts are from the tutorial, and I added the TypeScript part myself.

It's a pretend social media app that supports creating, editing, and reacting to posts. It uses Redux's `createSlice` and `createAction` methods, reducers, rendering components using data from a Redux store, multiple components using the same data, and dispatching updates to cause state updates.

In the future, I might continue the tutorial and get to the [Async Logic and Data Fetching](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-5-async-logic) part.
